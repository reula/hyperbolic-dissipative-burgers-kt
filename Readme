This directory contains the code for solving a 1-D 
force-free shocks with second order accuracy away from the shock.
This is done using the centered algorithm of Tadmor Kurganov

Identification of which component of the vector of variables is given
in first_macro.h. There you also specify several things, like the number
of grid points, etc.

Other parameters and initial boundary conditions are given in the file "data"


To run it do:

First create a subdirectory Current and install all files there, then create
there a subdirectory Dump 

then 

make 

and then 

./ff_exec
B
A
ff_exec

The output is managed in the file adisco.c 

To see the .dat files use (for instance) xmgrace: Data->import->ASCHI->block and choose block 2 and 3 (the first is the time, second position (grid value) and the third the field value.

To see the .pyg files use pygraph *.pyg 

pygraph is installed from: https://bitbucket.org/dradice/pygraph/overview

The initial data is in inidat.c
The equations are in mhd_eq_3d.c
The main in mhd_main.c
The i/o functions in adisco.c
The derivatives are computed using the Q matrix as in Kreiss. This is
implemented in deriv_3d.c. (for different Q's see the definition
of DERIV first_macro.h)
